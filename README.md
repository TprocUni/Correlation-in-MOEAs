# Correlation-in-MOEAs
The paper investigates how correlations among objectives impact the performance of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) and seeks to guide MOEA selection based on these correlations. Key findings reveal that:

Algorithm Types and Correlation:

Decomposition-based algorithms (e.g., MOEA/D) perform best in anti-correlated objective spaces, but they struggle with complex Pareto fronts.
Domination-based algorithms (like NSGA-II and SPEA2) demonstrate consistent performance, making them ideal for scenarios with unknown Pareto fronts.
Indicator-based algorithms (e.g., SMS-EMOA) generally underperform, particularly in negatively correlated scenarios.
Empirical Tests: The study tests MOEAs on problem sets (ZDT, DTLZ) representing various correlation scenarios. MOEA/D excelled in simpler objective spaces but faltered with disconnected and convex Pareto fronts. NSGA-III and SPEA2 showed stability across different correlation conditions.

Experimental Methodology:

Problem correlation is calculated using Pearsonâ€™s correlation, with random sampling to approximate the objective space.
Multiple runs are conducted to ensure robust results, with convergence and spread as primary performance metrics.
Conclusion and Recommendations:

Decomposition-based methods suit anti-correlated objectives without complex front shapes.
Domination-based methods are versatile and recommended for unknown or complex objective spaces.
Future research should explore high-dimensional objective spaces and custom problem generation.
This study highlights the importance of objective correlation in MOEA selection, suggesting specific algorithms for distinct correlation scenarios.
